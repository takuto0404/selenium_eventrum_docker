				"NSH@EDM: McDavid tallies 1,000th point of his NHL career",
				"EDMONTON -- Connor McDavid came close to collecting his 1,000th NHL point on his first shift against the Nashville Predators at Rogers Place on Thursday, nearly stuffing the puck in from behind the goal line on a scramble.",
				"The Edmonton Oilers captain was intent on reaching the milestone at home with his father Brian in attendance, and he got there in picturesque fashion instead at 2:44 of the second period, burying a one-timer off a pass from sidekick Leon Draisaitl on a 2-on-1 rush.",
				"With the goal, the 27-year-old became the 99th player to reach 1,000 points and the fourth-fastest to get there, accomplishing the feat in 659 games (341 goals, 660 assists). Only Wayne Gretzky (424 games), Mario Lemieux (513), and Mike Bossy (656) did it faster.",
				"“Just seeing the way the players reacted that means everything to me,” McDavid said. “Obviously, my teammates were happy and to hear the fans, that stuff means more to me than any of the numbers or anything like that. It was a really special moment, honestly. These milestones are a great time to reflect and a great time to look back. It’s been a great 10 years, and hopefully there are 10 more good ones.”",
				"Usually on the other end of a 2-on-1 as the one feeding Draisaitl, McDavid got off a good shot, then lost an edge, but regained his balance and drifted backwards into the corner where he was mobbed by his teammates as the Oilers poured off the bench.",
				"On the way to the celebration, Oilers defenseman Mattias Ekholm collected the puck and handed it to Draisaitl, who along with Darnell Nurse earned the assists on the historic goal. It was fitting the three were in on it considering they have been through the wars together for the past decade.",
				"“It is pretty fitting, actually. If there could have been a third assist, you would like to get [Ryan Nugent-Hopkins] in there as well somehow,” Draisaitl said. “It is certainly fitting, all three of us kind of came in at the same time year after year, three years in a row and knowing each other for a long time. We’ve become lifelong friends off of the ice and it is a good story.”",
				"As the pile in the corner dissipated, McDavid, Nurse and Draisaitl remained in an embrace extending the moment. Draisaitl then handed the puck to McDavid as the two skated back to the bench together.",
				"It was McDavid’s accomplishment, but the others played a part in helping him get there. Between assisting each other, or both assisting on another player's goal, Draisaitl and McDavid factored in on the same goal 445 times on the march to 1,000 points. Nurse and McDavid factored in on 103.",
				"“That means everything,” McDavid said. “They are teammates, guys you go to battle with, the guys that have been here forever through the good times and the bad times. You build a brotherhood, you build a bond and we certainly got that.",
				"“These moments are a great time to look back and appreciate the things and the people that mean a lot to you. Those two certainly are both.”",
				"The three combined again at 2:33 of overtime, when Nurse converted an outstanding behind-the-back feed from McDavid -- career point No. 1,001 -- to give Edmonton a 3-2 win. Reaching the milestone would not have been the same had the Oilers not been able to pull out the victory after giving up the tying goal with 2:48 left in the third period.",
				"“The three of us started us as kids basically and we’re 10 years into it together,” Nurse said. “You’ve been through the highs and lows together and special moments like this and milestones like this everyone is a part of it. It’s a special moment and I’m so happy for Connor that he gets to celebrate all the work that he puts in.”",
				"NSH@EDM: Nurse one-times McDavid's slick dish, winning the game in OT",
				"The 1,000-point milestone is the latest highlight in McDavid’s NHL career. He has won the Art Ross Trophy, which is awarded annually to the NHL’s leading scorer, five times (2017, 2018, 2021, 2022, 2023); the Ted Lindsay Award, which is given annually to the most outstanding player in the NHL as voted by fellow members of the NHL Players' Association, four times (2017, 2018, 2021, 2023); the Hart Trophy, which is awarded to the NHL's most valuable player, three times (2017, 2021, 2023); and the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy, which goes the League’s leading goal-scorer, once (2023).",
				"McDavid is still chasing his ultimate goal of winning the Stanley Cup, but as he continues to collect accolades, he is becoming more appreciative of the journey.",
				"“Some of these things have hit me a little more emotionally than I would have thought,” McDavid said. “You spend your whole life playing hockey and loving the game and you just want to play and make the NHL and 1,000 points later, I’ve been doing it for 10 years now. It’s pretty special. You take it for granted sometimes and these moments give you a chance to look back and be grateful.”",
				"Following the game, the Oilers took extra time in the dressing room to celebrate the win and McDavid's accomplishment. The players and staff then donned specially made T-shirts with a picture of a young McDavid in glasses and the words, \"This guy’s got 1000 NHL Pts??\"",
				"“I took this picture,” Draisaitl said. “I didn’t make them myself, but I was the guy to send out the picture and then Brad Harrison our equipment manager takes it from there and he’s good with stuff like that.”",
				"Considering McDavid has reached 1,000 points faster than a number of Hockey Hall of Fame members, including Peter Stastny (682 games), Jari Kurri (716), Guy Lafleur (720), Bryan Trottier (726), Denis Savard (727), Steve Yzerman (737), Marcel Dionne (740) and Phil Esposito (745), the question arises: Can he become only the second player in NHL history, along with Gretzky, to reach 2,000 points?",
				"“If not him, who else? That’s the only question,” Draisaitl said. “I never bet against Connor McDavid. I’ve learned that over the last 10 years and it wouldn’t surprise me.”"

A month later, he appeared in Iowa with Trump and endorsed the former president for the GOP nomination, days ahead of the first-in-the-nation caucuses.",
